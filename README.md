# Java-based fullstack coding exercise

## Tasks

Get to know the project and set it up.

* What does the project do?
* How can you run it?

The following sections list potential tasks to choose from.

### General tasks

1. Show the avatar and the name of the user who owns the question in the UI

2. Don't show questions that have *reputation* less than 20

3. Write an automated test for the questions API endpoint

4. Add a parameter to the questions API endpoint to limit the number of results returned

   * The default limit should be 5 if the parameter is not given

5. Add a parameter to the questions API endpoint to sort results by either questions' *title* or by question owners' *display name*

   * Describe how the result set might differ when sorting in our backend versus sorting in the 3rd party API

6. Add the location of the user who owns the question into returned data of questions

   * The location data might be missing for some users

Some tasks above can be backend-only.

### Frontend-only tasks

1. Make UI look prettier
